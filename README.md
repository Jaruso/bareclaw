## ADHD: Agent Driven Hyper Development

BareClaw is built around a core design principle: **ADHD — Agent Driven Hyper Development**.

The idea is that agents should be able to build, test, run, and iterate on BareClaw itself — as fast as possible, with zero friction — using BareClaw's own MCP server as the development harness.

```
read source → edit → build() → test() → run_agent() → inspect → iterate
     ↑                                                                ↓
     └───────────────── tight feedback loop, all in one session ──────┘
```

The MCP server (`mcp/`) is the **primary development interface**. It wraps the entire BareClaw CLI and build system as MCP tools so any agent (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or a BareClaw agent itself) can:

- Read and understand the Zig source
- Edit code and compile immediately
- Run the full test suite
- Send prompts to the live agent and inspect side effects
- Close the loop — all without leaving the conversation

**BareClaw agents can improve BareClaw.** A session running via Telegram or Discord can reason about and propose changes to its own Zig source — the same MCP tools the developer uses are available to any sufficiently capable agent.

See [`docs/mcp-development.md`](docs/mcp-development.md) for the full ADHD playbook and [`mcp/README.md`](mcp/README.md) for setup.

---

## Quick Start

**Requirements**: Zig 0.14+

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone <your-repo-url> bareclaw
cd bareclaw
zig build

# First-run setup
./zig-out/bin/bareclaw onboard

# Check status
./zig-out/bin/bareclaw status

# Run health diagnostics
./zig-out/bin/bareclaw doctor

# Chat with the agent
./zig-out/bin/bareclaw agent "What files are in my workspace?"

# Run tests
zig build test
```

### Setting your API key

BareClaw checks these environment variables in order:

```bash
export BARECLAW_API_KEY="your-key-here"   # preferred
export API_KEY="your-key-here"            # generic fallback
```

Without a key, BareClaw runs in **echo mode** — it reflects your input back as the reply, which is useful for testing tools and channels without an API.

---

## Configuration

Config lives at `~/.bareclaw/config.toml`. Run `bareclaw onboard` to create it, or edit it directly:

```toml
default_provider   = "anthropic"
default_model      = "claude-opus-4-5"
memory_backend     = "markdown"
fallback_providers = "openai,ollama"

# Optional channel tokens
discord_token  = "Bot.token.here"
telegram_token = "1234567890:your-telegram-token"
```

Tokens for Discord and Telegram can also be set via environment variables — those take precedence over the config file:

```bash
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="Bot.token.here"
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="1234567890:your-telegram-token"
```

---

---

## Providers

BareClaw supports multiple AI backends. Set `default_provider` in config or use the fallback chain.

### Anthropic (Claude)

```toml
default_provider = "anthropic"
default_model    = "claude-opus-4-5"
```

```bash
export BARECLAW_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

Uses the native Anthropic Messages API (`POST /v1/messages`). Tool-use blocks (`tool_use`) are automatically translated to the internal OpenAI-compatible format so the agent loop works identically regardless of backend.

### OpenAI

```toml
default_provider = "openai"
default_model    = "gpt-4o"
```

```bash
export BARECLAW_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

### OpenAI-Compatible (any clone)

```toml
default_provider = "openai-compatible"
default_model    = "your-model-name"
```

```bash
export BARECLAW_API_KEY="your-key"
export BARECLAW_API_URL="https://your-openai-clone.example.com"
```

### Ollama (local, no key required)

```toml
default_provider = "ollama"
default_model    = "llama3"
```

Connects to `http://localhost:11434` by default. No API key needed.

### OpenRouter

```toml
default_provider = "openrouter"
default_model    = "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5"
```

```bash
export BARECLAW_API_KEY="sk-or-..."
```

### Echo (offline / testing)

```toml
default_provider = "echo"
```

Reflects the user message back as the reply. No network calls. Useful for testing tools, channels, and cron without an API key.

### Fallback / Router

Configure a comma-separated fallback chain. BareClaw tries each provider in order and returns the first successful response:

```toml
default_provider   = "anthropic"
fallback_providers = "openai,ollama,echo"
```

---

## Tools

The agent can call any of these tools during a conversation. Tools are executed with the real security policy and memory context.

| Tool | Description | Key Arguments |
|---|---|---|
| `shell` | Run a shell command via `/bin/sh -c` | `command` |
| `file_read` | Read a file from the workspace | `path` |
| `file_write` | Write content to a file in the workspace | `path`, `content` |
| `memory_store` | Persist a value to the memory backend | `key`, `content` |
| `memory_recall` | Retrieve a stored value | `key` |
| `memory_forget` | Delete a stored memory entry | `key` |
| `http_request` | Make a GET or POST HTTP request | `url`, `method`, `body` |
| `git_operations` | Run git subcommands in a workspace path | `op`, `path`, `args` |

**Allowed git operations**: `status`, `log`, `diff`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `clone`, `init`, `branch`, `checkout`, `fetch`, `stash`

All tool calls are logged to the audit log before execution.

---

## Channels

Channels are the interfaces through which users (or bots) interact with BareClaw.

### CLI — Single Turn

```bash
bareclaw channel
```

Prompts for one line of input, runs the agent, prints the reply, exits.

### CLI — Interactive Loop

```bash
bareclaw channel loop
```

A full REPL. Type messages, get replies. Type `exit` or `quit` to stop.

### Discord

```bash
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="Bot.your.token"
bareclaw channel discord
```

Connects to the Discord Gateway via WebSocket (TLS). Listens for `MESSAGE_CREATE` events and replies to every non-bot message in-channel. Handles heartbeats, reconnection, and pong frames automatically.

**Setup**:
1. Create a bot at [discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers)
2. Enable the **Message Content Intent** under Privileged Gateway Intents
3. Invite the bot to your server with `Send Messages` permission
4. Set `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and run

### Telegram

```bash
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="1234567890:your-token"
bareclaw channel telegram
```

Long-polls `getUpdates` (30-second timeout). Processes each text message through the agent and replies via `sendMessage`. Automatically advances the update offset to avoid duplicates.

**Setup**:
1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram to create a bot
2. Copy the token and set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
3. Run `bareclaw channel telegram`

---

## Memory

BareClaw stores persistent memory as Markdown files under `~/.bareclaw/workspace/memory/`.

Each `memory_store` call writes `<key>.md`. `memory_recall` reads it back. `memory_forget` deletes it.

The agent automatically stores the last user message as `last_message` after each successful turn.

```bash
# View your memory files directly
ls ~/.bareclaw/workspace/memory/
```

The `status` command shows a count of stored memory files.

---

## Security

BareClaw enforces a layered security model:

### Path Policy

`file_read`, `file_write`, and `git_operations` all validate paths before execution:

- **Directory traversal blocked**: any path containing `..` is rejected
- **Forbidden system paths**: `/etc/`, `/root/`, `/usr/`, `/proc/`, `/sys/`, `/dev/` are always blocked
- **Sensitive directories blocked**: paths containing `/.ssh`, `/.gnupg`, `/.aws`, or `/.bareclaw/secrets` are rejected
- **Absolute paths**: must be inside `workspace_dir`
- **Relative paths**: allowed (resolved relative to workspace)

### Shell Command Blocklist

The `shell` tool blocks a set of destructive command patterns before execution (e.g. `rm -rf`, `mkfs`, `dd if=`, `:(){ :|:& };:`). This is a defense-in-depth layer — it is not a sandbox. Full sandboxing requires OS-level isolation.

### Audit Log

Every tool call is appended to `~/.bareclaw/workspace/audit.log` before execution:

```
1700000000	shell	ls -la
1700000001	file_read	notes.md
1700000002	memory_store	last_message
```

Format: `unix_timestamp TAB tool_name TAB detail`

---

## Cron

BareClaw includes a lightweight task scheduler. Tasks are persisted as a TSV file at `~/.bareclaw/cron.tsv`.

```bash
# Add a task (schedule field is stored but not yet parsed for time-based firing)
bareclaw cron add "0 9 * * *" "echo good morning"

# List all tasks
bareclaw cron list

# Pause / resume
bareclaw cron pause <id>
bareclaw cron resume <id>

# Run all enabled tasks right now
bareclaw cron run

# Remove a task
bareclaw cron remove <id>
```

The `daemon` command runs `cron run` alongside the HTTP gateway so tasks execute on daemon startup. Time-based scheduling (cron expression parsing) is on the roadmap.

---

## Gateway & Daemon

### Gateway

```bash
bareclaw gateway
```

Starts a minimal HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:8080`:

| Endpoint | Method | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `/health` | GET | `{"status":"ok","service":"bareclaw"}` |
| `/webhook` | POST | `{"received":true}` |

### Daemon

```bash
bareclaw daemon
```

Runs the gateway and cron runner together. Intended as a long-running background process for server deployments.

```

**No external dependencies** — BareClaw uses only the Zig standard library. TLS (for Discord WebSocket and HTTPS), HTTP, JSON parsing, and crypto are all stdlib.

### How the Agent Loop Works

1. User message is sent to the configured provider
2. If the response contains `tool_calls`, each tool is dispatched with a real `ToolContext` (policy + memory)
3. Tool results are appended to a context buffer and fed back to the model as a follow-up turn
4. This repeats up to 8 rounds (`MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS`)
5. When the model produces a plain text response (no tool calls), it is printed and the turn ends

The Anthropic `tool_use` block format is translated to the internal OpenAI `tool_calls` format transparently, so the agent loop is provider-agnostic.
